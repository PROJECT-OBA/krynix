/**
 * Local approval-handler API — the OSS counterpart to the hosted
 * `ApprovalPoller`.
 *
 * The hosted approval pathway (`ApprovalPoller`) submits a row to the
 * Krynix ingest server and polls the resolution endpoint. That requires
 * an ingest endpoint, which is a team / paid-tier surface.
 *
 * The `approvalHandler` callback resolves `require-approval` verdicts
 * **without** an ingest server. Same wire shape — `ApprovalDecision` —
 * different transport. Three built-in handlers ship:
 *
 *   - `denyAllApprovalHandler`     — deny-by-default, useful as a strict
 *                                    fallback when human review is
 *                                    unavailable
 *   - `cliPromptApprovalHandler`   — pause the agent, prompt on stdin,
 *                                    parse `y` / `n` (CLI agents, dev)
 *   - `webhookApprovalHandler`     — POST the approval event to a URL,
 *                                    await the resolution (server-side
 *                                    agents wired to existing approval
 *                                    flow)
 *
 * Bring-your-own is also fine: anything matching the `ApprovalHandler`
 * type works. The runtime will prefer a configured `ApprovalPoller`
 * over a configured `ApprovalHandler` if both are present — hosted
 * approvals carry audit trail + human-review UI, which the local path
 * doesn't.
 *
 * Added in `@krynix/sdk@0.1.0-alpha.2`. See krynix-internal strategic
 * review §1 for the design rationale.

 * Resolve a `require-approval` verdict using whichever transport the

 * The poller is preferred over the handler when both are configured —
 * hosted approvals come with the lens UI + audit trail + multi-human
 * review queue, which the local path doesn't.
 *
 * Return semantics (in all branches):
 * - resolves with `{ action: "approve" }` (human or local handler
 *   explicitly approved) or `{ action: "approve_after_timeout" }` (soft-
 *   block timed out and the rule's `on_timeout` was `"allow"`) or
 *   `{ action: "approve_with_redactions", redactions }` → adapter

 * - throws `ApprovalDenied` → adapter propagates to the caller
 * - throws `ApprovalTimeout` → only from the poller; soft-block timeout
 *   that resolved to deny
 * - throws `ApprovalUnavailable` → neither transport is configured;
 *   caller must configure one
 *
 * The `approve` vs `approve_after_timeout` split lets adapters tell the
 * audit story honestly: a human approved the call vs the agent acted
 * because of an `on_timeout: "allow"` policy default — both forward,
 * but the trace record is different.

 *   rule + in-flight request. This is the **single source of truth** —
 *   `ruleId`, `onTimeout`, and the underlying `policyDecisionEvent` are
 *   all derived from it. Adapters build it once; both transports see
 *   the same values. This shape was tightened in alpha.2 (post-#57
 *   review) to remove a footgun where mismatched parallel parameters
 *   could route the poller to one rule while the handler webhook
 *   showed another.
